# Report on Next Steps for the @llm-orchestration/core Framework

## 1. Executive Summary

The `@llm-orchestration/core` framework is a well-structured and promising project that provides a solid foundation for building LLM-powered workflows. However, it is currently in an early stage of development and requires several improvements to be considered a mature, production-ready framework. The most critical areas for improvement are the complete lack of tests for the core framework, incomplete and misleading documentation, and the need for more robust error handling and state management. This report outlines a series of actionable recommendations to address these issues and prepare the framework for public release.

## 2. Documentation Improvements

The documentation is the first point of contact for new users and contributors. It's crucial that it is accurate, complete, and easy to understand.

- **Update `README.md`:**
  - Replace placeholder values like `your-org` and `your-project` with the actual project details or clear instructions for the user to do so.
  - Fix broken links to documentation files that do not exist (e.g., `docs/architecture.md`). Either create these files or remove the links.
  - Clarify the purpose of the root-level `tests` directory to avoid confusion. Explain that it contains integration tests for a specific application, not the core framework.
- **Create a `CONTRIBUTING.md` file:**
  - This file should provide clear guidelines for new contributors, including how to set up the development environment, run tests (once they are created), and submit pull requests.
- **Add Inline Code Comments:**
  - While the code is generally well-written, adding more inline comments to explain complex logic in the `Orchestrator` and `WorkflowRunner` would be beneficial.

## 3. Configuration and Setup

A smooth setup process is essential for attracting new users.

- **Create a `.env.example` file:**
  - Add a `.env.example` file to the root of the `src-core` package. This file should list all the required environment variables with placeholder values, making it easy for developers to set up their own `.env` file.
- **Improve Configuration Options:**
  - Allow the workflow timeout to be configurable on a per-workflow basis instead of being a global setting in the `WorkflowRunner`.
  - Consider adding a configuration option to limit the number of parallel steps that can be executed at once.

## 4. Testing Strategy

The lack of tests is the most critical issue that needs to be addressed.

- **Create a `tests` directory in `src-core`:**
  - Create a dedicated `tests` directory inside `src-core` to house all the tests for the framework. This will keep the tests organized and separate from the application-specific tests at the root of the project.
- **Write Unit Tests for Core Components:**
  - Write unit tests for the `Orchestrator`, `WorkflowRunner`, and other core components. These tests should cover all public methods and handle various scenarios, including success cases, error cases, and edge cases.
  - Use the `MockDataClient` and mock implementations of the `AIProvider` to isolate the components under test.
- **Write Integration Tests for Workflows:**
  - Create integration tests that execute a complete workflow from start to finish. These tests should use a combination of mock and real (if possible) components to verify that the entire system works as expected.
- **Set Up a CI/CD Pipeline:**
  - Implement a continuous integration (CI) pipeline (e.g., using GitHub Actions) that automatically runs the tests on every push and pull request. This will ensure that all new code is tested and doesn't introduce regressions.

## 5. Code and Architecture Enhancements

These improvements will make the framework more robust and feature-rich.

- **Advanced Error Handling:**
  - Implement more sophisticated error handling strategies. For example, allow a workflow to continue even if one of the parallel steps fails.
  - Introduce the concept of a "step-level" error handler that can be defined in the workflow configuration.
- **State Persistence and Resumption:**
  - Implement a mechanism in the `WorkflowRunner` to persist the workflow state to the `dataClient` at regular intervals.
  - Add a method to the `WorkflowRunner` to resume a workflow from a persisted state. This will make the framework more resilient to crashes.
- **Flesh out Existing Features:**
  - Expand on the "human review" feature by adding a mechanism to notify a human and wait for their input before proceeding.
  - Implement the "fallback routes" feature to allow a workflow to gracefully handle the failure of a primary action.

## 6. Packaging and Distribution

To make the framework easily consumable by other developers, it should be published as a package to a public registry like npm.

- **Prepare for Publishing:**
  - Ensure that the `package.json` file in `src-core` has all the correct information, including the author, license, repository URL, and a descriptive name.
  - Create a `.npmignore` file to exclude unnecessary files (like tests) from the published package.
- **Publish to npm:**
  1.  **Login to npm:** Run `npm login` in your terminal and enter your npm credentials.
  2.  **Build the package:** Run `pnpm run build` from within the `src-core` directory to compile the TypeScript code to JavaScript.
  3.  **Publish the package:** Run `pnpm publish --access public` from within the `src-core` directory to publish the package to the npm registry.
